//# nf-core sarek pipeline
<!-- 
A workflow designed to detect variants on whole genome or targeted sequencing data. Initially designed for Human, and Mouse, it can work on any species with a reference genome. Sarek can also handle tumour / normal pairs and could include additional relapses.
-->

## How to use:
<!--
Link to a webpage, web shell (e.g. runkit), or downloadable executable that demonstrates the project. 
        * note that when the reader is modifying the code, they will compare their modified version to the demo to see if their changes worked as they expected them to. Your demo is their reference
-->

### Installation:
<!--Explain how to import the modules of the project into the reader's codebase, install the containers of the project in the reader's cluster, or flash the binary of the project onto the reader's hardware-->

## How Project Name works:
<!--
Explain how execution works. What is the entry point for your code? Which files correspond to which functionality? What is the lifecycle of your project? Are there any singletons, side effects or shared state among instances of your project? Take extra care to explain design decisions. After all, you wrote an ENTIRE codebase around your opinions. Make sure that the people using it understand them.
-->

## Roadmap:
<!--
List the releases that you have added to each project, and any future releases you would like to do. If there is a date for future release, put it here. If not, let people know that there is no defined timeframe for future releases.
-->


#### Repository Structure:
<!--
List each file, and what it does.
    * Identify whether you are open to pull requests for a specific file or not.
-->

| File or Folder | What does it do? | When should you modify it? |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------- |
|                |                  |                            |

### Test:
<!--
When the reader runs the code, what are the expected inputs and outputs?
How can the reader tell if the code is malfunctioning?
-->

### Document:
<!--
How should the reader document changes and additions to the code?
