# MD Scholarly Activity Project (2023-2025)
# Bioinformatic Analyses of Skin and Uveal Melanoma Tumours

## Description

### Aim:
To understand treatment responses in skin and uveal melanoma tumours. 

### The Dataset:

Two biobanks of melanoma tumors from a phase 3 clinical trial run in Sweden (the SCANDIUM trial) and the Perkins metastatic melanoma biobank. 

#### Test Data:
Test data that is used for automated testing. Originally for the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline.
https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/rnaseq

- test/data/*.fastq.gz: Historical single-end test data for pipeline sub-sampled to ~2000 reads 
- test/data/GSE110004/*.fastq.gz: Paired-end test data for pipeline sub-sampled to 50000 reads
- test/reference/: Sub-sampled genome reference files (iGenomes S. cerevisiae R64-1-1 Ensembl release)

### Methodology:

TBA
